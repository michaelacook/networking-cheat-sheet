# CCNA Routing & Switching Command Cheat Sheet

This is a cheatsheet of Cisco IOS commands compiled from my college networking courses. I do not own the commands, but the notes are licensed under the CCO, so feel free to take them and do whatever you want with them. Also, feel free to contribute with a pull request.
